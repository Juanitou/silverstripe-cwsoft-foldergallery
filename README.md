## Requirements
The minimum requirements to get the cwsoft-foldergallery module running on your SilverStripe installation are as follows:

- SilverStripe ***3.0.x***
- PHP ***5.3*** or higher (recommended last stable PHP 5.4.x version)

## Installation
1. download latest [module archive](https://github.com/cwsoft/silverstripe-cwsoft-foldergallery/archive/3.0.x.zip) from GitHub
2. unpack the archive on your local computer
3. upload the entire `cwsoft-foldergallery` folder to your SilverStripe root folder using your preferred Ftp program
4. update your SilverStripe database via `http://yourdomain.com/dev/build?flush=all`

## Adapt foldergallery layout to match your theme layout
By default, the Foldergallery layout matches the SilverStripe 3.x standard `simple` theme layout. You can adapt the Foldergallery layout to match your theme by following the steps below.

1. copy `themes/your-theme/templates/Layout/Page.ss` to `cwsoft-foldergallery/templates/Layout/cwsFolderGalleryPage.ss`
2. add the code `<% include Foldergallery %>` after `$Content` (in file cwsFolderGalleryPage.ss)
3. flush the cache and visit the Foldergallery page in your frontend

## Usage
To setup a `cwsoft-foldergallery` page with two albums "Animals" and "Buildings", just follow the steps shown in the sketch below. The steps below assume you have already installed the module before.

![](docs/cwsoft-foldergallery-backend.png) 

1. Create a page of type `Foldergallery` (will serve as album overview) and save it (saving will create the folder 'assets/cwsoft-foldergallery for you)
2. Create album folders `animals` and `buildings` inside `assets/cwsoft-foldergallery` via SilverStripe Files section and upload images to it. Images named "001-this-will-be-the-first-image.jpg" get a description as follows: "This will be the first image". The first image in an album folder will be used as album cover image.
3. For the album overview page (container), we do not need to select an album image folder. This step is only required for the album children pages created in step 5
4. Provide a description for the album overview page or the album pages via the WYSIWYG editor and save the page if done
5. Now create child pages of type `Foldergallery` for the albums `Animals` and `Buildings`. Choose the album image folder from the dropdown box (3) and provide a album description via the WYSIWYG editor (4) and save the pages

Tip: If you do just want to show a single page with images on it, just follow steps 1 through 4, but choose an image folder in step 3.
